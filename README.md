# Fleecia

Fleecia is a Discord bot for managing personal, colorful roles in your servers.
It's designed with a focus on servers of friends, to allow every member to customize their own color.
They can also create their own "titles" by changing the name of these colorful roles.

You still have complete control over the permissions and colors of all roles created this way.
Fleecia only changes the color of the role, and tracks which user it is tied to interally.
If you happen to already be doing something like this in your server, you can link existing roles to users.
